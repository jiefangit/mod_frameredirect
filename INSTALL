Installation requires a compiler, standard system include files and
the usual Apache development libraries.

Use the apxs2 script included in your Apache distribution to perform
the installation:

apxs2 -i -a -c mod_frameredirect.c

In Debian this will create a standard load script and enable the
module from the next Apache server restart.
